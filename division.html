				<h1> Division</h1>
				<p> Division is a way of splitting things equally. </p>
				<p>Take this picture for example</p>
				<div id ="pic">
				<img src="Division.png" alt="Picture" style="width:300px;height:150px">
				</div>
				<p>Lets say you have 10 tickets and 5 friends and you want to divide them out evenly
				<div id ="pic">
				<img src="Division2.png" alt="Picture" style="width:300px;height:150px">
				</div>
				<p> We divide them out evenly so that they have 2 each so therefore 10&divide;2 = 5</p>
				<p>The &divide; sign symbolises division in equations so Five divided by Five is written as 5&divide;5</p>
				<p>Now that you have an understanding of Division tryout a few sample questions <a href ="Qs.html">here</a> or play our quiz game <a href ="Quiz.html">here</a>.</p>
