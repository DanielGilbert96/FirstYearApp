				<h1> Multiplication</h1>
				<p> Multiplication is a way to increase a number over and over. Multiplying is a faster way of adding more then one thing for example if you had 4 sweets + 4 sweets + 4 sweets you could just multiply 4 times 3 to get the same answer</p>
				<p>4+4 = 8 + 4 = 12 and 4x3 = 12</p>
