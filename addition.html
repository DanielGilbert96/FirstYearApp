				<h1> Addition</h1>
				<p> Addition is a way to put things together. When you add two amounts you're counting them together as one larger amount</p>
				<p>Take this picture of rabbits for example</p>
				<div id ="pic">
				<img src="Addition.png" alt="Picture" style="width:300px;height:150px">
				</div>
				<p> in this picture we count 4 rabbits and add them to another 4 becoming 8</p>
				<p>The + sign symbolises plus in equations so Five plus Five is written as 5+5</p>
				<p>Now that you have an understanding of addition tryout a few sample questions <a href ="Qs.html">here</a> or play our quiz game <a href ="Quiz.html">here</a>.</p>
